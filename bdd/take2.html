            Vue.js Gherkin .feature File Viewer/Editor Requirements Summary:

            1. Single HTML File Implementation: Entire app contained within one HTML file using Vue 3.
            
            2. Vue 3 Usage: Build the application with Vue 3, leveraging its reactivity and component system.

            3. Gherkin Feature File Management: Enable viewing, searching, and editing Gherkin .feature files.

            4. Component-Based Design: 
                - FeatureViewer: Displays .feature file content.
                - FeatureEditor: Edits .feature file with Gherkin syntax highlighting.
                - SearchBar: Searches through feature files or their contents.
                - FeatureList: Lists feature files for selection and navigation.

            5. Data Structure: Represent .feature files in a structured format like JSON, including file name and content.

            6. Editable Content: Allow editing of feature file content and update the data structure accordingly.

            7. Search Functionality: Implement feature to search and filter specific feature files or contents.

            8. Scoped Styling: Use scoped CSS within Vue components for styling.

            9. Assumptions and Additional Features: 
                - Initial .feature files are hardcoded or pre-loaded.
                - Optional: Add new feature files, version control, history tracking.

            10. Responsive and User-Friendly UI: Ensure intuitive use, clear layout, and navigation.

            11. Assumed Knowledge: Familiarity with Vue.js, component architecture, and Gherkin syntax.

            12. No Backend Integration Assumed: Frontend-only solution without data persistence across sessions.

            This comment block outlines the intended functionality and design for the Vue.js Gherkin .feature file viewer/editor.

            Sample Input is in ["SAMPLE_INPUT.feature"]

            ===

            Actionable Next Steps:
            - [ ] Parser: Parse .feature files into a structured format like JSON.
            - [ ] Define our "structured" format (similar to an AST) for .feature files and define TypeScript types for it.
            - [ ] (Later) Exporter that can export JSON OR convert back into common .feature files.
            - [ ] (Later) Add a "New Feature" button that creates a new feature file and adds it to the list.
                - [ ] (Later) Add a "Delete Feature" button that deletes a feature file from the list.
                - [ ] (Later) Ability to Edit a Feature's Properties (Name, Description, Tags, etc.)
            - [ ] (Later) Add a "New Scenario" button that creates a new scenario in the selected feature file.
                - [ ] (Later) Add a "Delete Scenario" button that deletes a scenario from the selected feature file.
                - [ ] (Later) Ability to Edit a Scenario's Properties (Name, Description, Tags, etc.)
            - [ ] (Later) Add a "New Step" button that creates a new step in the selected scenario.
                - [ ] (Later) Add a "Delete Step" button that deletes a step from the selected scenario.
                - [ ] (Later) Ability to Edit a Step's Properties (Name, Description, Tags, etc.)

        Feature: User Account Address Management
    As a user, when I am logged in,
    I should be able to view and update my default billing and shipping addresses from the My Account page

    As a user, when registering for a sale,
    I should be able to view and update my default billing and shipping addresses from the Address Selection modal

  Background: 
    Given the system is initialized

  @AddressManagement @MyAccount
  Scenario: User does not have an address on file in My Account
    Given the user is on the My Account page
    Then the Default Billing Address should display "No Address Entered"
    When the user clicks the "Add" button below Default Billing Address
    Then a modal should display fields: Name, Last Name, Company, street address
    And Name, Last Name and Company should be auto completed according to the account registration record
    When the user begins by entering a valid street address into the street address field
    Then a list of addresses that match the user's input should be displayed
    When the user selects an address from the address recommendation list
    Then the following fields should be displayed and filled with the address information: country, street address, city, state and zipcode
    When the user clicks "CONTINUE"
    And the user accepts the billing address as the shipping address by clicking "YES"
    Then the addresses should be saved under the Account Information section

  @AddressManagement @MyAccount
  Scenario: User has address on file in My Account
    Given the user is on the My Account page and has a default billing address on file
    When the user clicks the "update" button below Default Billing Address
    Then a modal should display fields: name, last name, Company, country, street address, address 2, city, state and zipcode filled according to the billing address on file
    When the user clicks "CONTINUE"
    And the user accepts the billing address as the shipping address by clicking "YES"
    Then the addresses should be saved under the Account Information section

  @AddressManagement @Registration
  Scenario: User does not have an address on file during registration
    When the user clicks the "REGISTER TO BID" button
    And the user accepts the Terms of Sale and clicks "CONTINUE"

    When the user clicks "CONTINUE"
    And the user accepts the billing address as the shipping address by clicking "YES"
    Then the addresses should be on file under My Account in the Billing and Shipping Addresses section

  @AddressManagement @Registration
  Scenario: User has address on file during registration
    When the user clicks the "REGISTER TO BID" button
