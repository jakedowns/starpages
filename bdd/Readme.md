## Getting Started

This section guides you through the initial setup and running the Gherkin Feature Manager.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of TypeScript and Node.js.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository-url]`.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

### Running the Application

To run both the client and server simultaneously, we use `concurrently`. This is defined in the `package.json` under scripts.

1. **Start the Development Server for Client**
   - The client application uses Vite. You can start the Vite development server using the script defined in `package.json`.

2. **Start the Node.js Server**
   - The Node.js server is written in TypeScript. Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to watch and compile the server files.

3. **Run Both Servers Concurrently**
   - To run both servers simultaneously, use the command `npm run both`. This command leverages `concurrently` to run both the Vite development server and the Node.js server in watch mode.

After running this command, your client application should be accessible at the default Vite URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`), and your Node.js server will be listening on its configured port.
```

You can insert this content into your project's `README.md` file under the "Getting Started" section. Make sure to replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL of your repository.

## Plan of Action

## Introduction
This document outlines the development plan for the Gherkin Feature Manager, a comprehensive backend system designed to manage and execute Gherkin features. It includes CRUD operations for features, scenarios, and steps, integration with Gherkin and Cucumber for feature execution, and real-time result streaming via WebSocket.

9. **Documentation and Final Steps**

### 1. Initial Setup
   - **Dependencies**: List and install necessary dependencies like Express, TypeORM, Socket.IO, Cucumber, Gherkin, etc.
   - **Server Setup**: Basic Express server initialization.
   - **Database Connection**: Establish a connection to the database using TypeORM.

### 2. Model Definitions and Updates
   - **Feature, Scenario, Step Models**: Define these models and their relationships.
   - **Folder Model**: Create a model for organizing features.
   - **Update Feature Model**: Include `folder_sort_position` in the Feature model.

### 3. CRUD Operations
   - **Feature Routes**: Implement routes and handlers for CRUD operations on features.
   - **Scenario Routes**: Implement routes and handlers for CRUD operations on scenarios.
   - **Step Routes**: Implement routes and handlers for CRUD operations on steps.
   - **Folder Routes**: Implement routes and handlers for CRUD operations on folders.

### 4. Gherkin and Cucumber Integration
   - **Gherkin Parsing**: Implement logic to parse and validate Gherkin syntax.
   - **Cucumber Execution**: Execute features using Cucumber.
   - **Virtual Features**: Handle execution of virtual features defined in JSON.

### 5. WebSocket Integration for Real-Time Results
   - **Setup Socket.IO**: Integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication.
   - **Stream Results**: Implement logic to stream Cucumber execution results to the client.

### 6. Advanced Features and Considerations
   - **Job Queueing**: Implement a system for queuing and managing test execution jobs.
   - **Worker Pool Management**: Manage a dynamic pool of workers for test execution.
   - **Error Handling and Validation**: Implement comprehensive error handling and input validation.
   - **Security**: Ensure secure handling of requests and data.

### 7. Testing and Debugging
   - **Write Tests**: Develop tests for server routes and logic.
   - **Debugging**: Strategies and tools for effective debugging.

### 8. Deployment and Scaling Considerations
   - **Deployment Prep**: Prepare the application for deployment.
   - **Scaling**: Plan and implement scaling strategies.

### 9. Documentation and Final Steps
   - **API Documentation**: Document the API endpoints and usage.
   - **Code Review**: Conduct a final review of the codebase.

## Conclusion
This plan serves as a guideline for the development of the Gherkin Feature Manager, ensuring a structured and comprehensive approach to building a robust and functional system.
